
Part-1 :
IDEA:
Women are less likely than men to choose biking for commuting
NULL HYPOTHESIS:
The proportion of men biking on weekends is the same or higher than the proportion of women biking on weekends

I used a significance level  α=0.05α=0.05 


Part-2:

Tests of correlation using the scipy package with citibike data.

which means i want the probability of getting a result at least as significant as mine to be less then 5%



Used the following are 3 tests to assess correlation between 2 samples of citibike data:
•	Pearson’s test
•	Spearman’s test
•	K-S test

Use: trip duration of bikers that ride during the day vs night. 
Use: age of bikers for trips originating in Manhattan and in Brooklyn.
